# mousesc-pop-model

### Usage:

Run each of the functions in the directory "figsNoGUI" to generate the population plots in the desired figure. \
(e.g., run fig3_noGUI to generate the orientation preferences plots in Figure 3.)

You can select different stimulus and receptive field parameters from the pre-generated set of neural responses by changing the loadfile specified in the comments of each figure script.

You will also need to download the pre-generated simulated neural responses from [OSF](https://osf.io/bu9cm/) and add the directory to your MATLAB path. \
(note: code for generating data yourself to be uploaded at a later date)

All code was tested to be compatible with Matlab 2023b and 2024a.
